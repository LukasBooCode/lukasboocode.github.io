                            <h3>Why hast thou picked the HZ HBO-ICT programme?</h3>
                            <p>I enjoy stimulating challenges. The ICT-field offers these. It is, to me, just the right
                                blend of research and application. Ever since I was young, I've been able to enter 6+
                                hour flow states where I work continuously, whether that be something creative,
                                something technical, or studying for school. These flow states assisted me in building
                                this website. As for why I am the way I am, I suppose it's just a combination between
                                genetics and environment that eventually made me the person I am today. At a base level,
                                this is simply what my being is attracted to, deeper than that I cannot go. Even one's
                                degree of self-determination and metacognition is predetermined.</p>
                            <h3>Former experience and proof for my claims.</h3>
                            <p>The first piece of proof is, no doubt, this website. Some features took me hours to
                                implement because my brain enjoys overcomplicating even the most basic problems. I
                                learnt HTML and CSS using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"
                                    target="_blank">W3Schools</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a> as
                                    well as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>. In addition, unrelated to this
                                    website, I've build simple applications for forward-projected investment returns as
                                    well as math problems in Python, and am currently working through <a
                                        href="https://www.learncpp.com" target="_blank">LearnCPP</a> in my free time.
                                    One thing I enjoy about C++ is that incentivizes learning about memory allocation,
                                    as well as basic computer science to understand how the code you write is translated
                                    into machine code, allowing you more clarity on topics like memory managment and
                                    optimization, wheras a higher-level programming language like Python doesn't require
                                    you to do that.</p>
                            <h3>What I'm hoping to get out of this course</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Time management. Slow learner and chronic slacker here. I would do well with
                                    structure and
                                    deadlines.</li>
                                <li>Figuring out what employers want from me. How can I make myself useful?</li>
                                <li>Expose myself to stressors that reveal my strengths and weak points. <i>"Software
